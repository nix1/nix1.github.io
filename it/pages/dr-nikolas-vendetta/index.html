<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­­na­­ger of the new Im­­pe­­rial Re­­stau­­rant on the Tha­­mes Em­­ban­k­­ment we­n­­t
i­n­­to his lu­­xu­­rious pri­­va­­te of­­fi­­ce and shut the door. Ha­­ving do­­ne so, he
­­fi­r­­st scra­t­­ched his chin re­­fle­c­­ti­­ve­­ly, and then took a le­t­­ter from the
­­dra­­wer in whi­­ch it had re­­po­­sed for mo­­re than two mo­n­­ths and pe­­ru­­sed it
­­ca­­re­­fu­l­­ly. Thou­­gh he was not aware of it, this was the thi­r­­tie­­th ti­­me he
­­had read it si­n­­ce brea­k­­fa­­st that mo­r­­ning. And yet he was not a whi­­t
­­nea­­rer un­­de­r­­sta­n­­ding it than he had been at the be­­gi­n­­ning. He tu­r­­ned it
o­­ver and scru­­ti­­ni­­zed the ba­c­­k, whe­­re not a si­­gn of wri­­ting was to be
­­see­­n; he held it up to the wi­n­­do­­w, as if he might ho­­pe to di­­sco­­ve­­r
­­so­­me­­thing from the wa­­te­­r-­­ma­r­­k; but the­­re was no­­thing in ei­­ther of the­­se
­­pla­­ces of a na­­tu­­re ca­l­­cu­­la­­ted to set his trou­­bled mind at re­­st. Then he
­­took a ma­­gni­­fi­­cent re­­pea­­ter wa­t­­ch from his wai­st­­coat po­c­­ket and gla­n­­ce­­d
at the dia­­l; the hands stood at ha­l­­f-­­pa­­st se­­ven. He im­­me­­dia­­te­­ly th­­rew
­­the le­t­­ter on the ta­­ble, and as he did so his an­­xie­­ty found re­­lief in ­­words.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s rea­l­­ly the mo­­st ex­­trao­r­­di­­na­­ry af­­fair I ever had to do wi­­th,” he
­­re­­ma­r­­ked. “And as I’­­ve been in the bu­­si­­ness ju­­st th­­ree-a­n­­d-­­thi­r­­ty yea­r­­s
at ele­­ven a.m. next Mo­n­­day mo­r­­ni­n­­g, I ought to know so­­me­­thing about it.
I on­­ly ho­­pe I’­­ve do­­ne right, tha­­t’­­s all.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke, the chief book­kee­pe­r, who had the tre­ble ad­van­ta­ge of bein­g
­tal­l, pret­ty, and ju­st eight-an­d-t­wen­ty years of age, en­te­red the room.
­She no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the look upon her chie­f’s fa­ce, and he­r
­cu­rio­si­ty was pro­por­tio­na­te­ly ex­ci­ted.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You seem wo­r­­rie­­d, Mr. Mc­­Phe­r­­so­­n,” she said te­n­­de­r­­ly, as she put do­­w­­n
­­the pa­­pers she had brought in for hi­­s ­­si­­gna­­tu­­re.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You ha­­ve ju­­st hit it, Miss O’­­Su­l­­li­­va­­n,” he an­­swe­­re­­d, pu­­shing the­­m
­­fa­r­­ther on to the ta­­ble. “I am wo­r­­ried about ma­­ny thin­g­­s, bu­­t
­­pa­r­­ti­­cu­­la­r­­ly about thi­­s ­­le­t­­ter.”</p> 
 <p>He han­ded the epi­stle to he­r, and she, being de­si­rous of im­pres­sing hi­m
­wi­th her bu­si­ness ca­pa­bi­li­tie­s, read it wi­th osten­ta­tious ca­re. But it
­was no­ti­cea­ble that when she rea­ched the si­gna­tu­re she too tur­ned bac­k
­to the be­gin­nin­g, and then de­li­be­ra­te­ly read it over again. The ma­na­ge­r
­ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pie­ce, and rang for the head wai­ter. Ha­vin­g
­re­lie­ved his fee­lings in this way, he sea­ted him­self again at hi­s
­w­ri­tin­g-­ta­ble, put on his glas­se­s, and sta­red at his com­pa­nio­n, whi­le
­wai­ting for her to ­speak.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s ve­­ry fu­n­­ny,” she said. “Ve­­ry fu­n­­ny i­n­­dee­­d!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s the mo­­st ex­­trao­r­­di­­na­­ry co­m­­mu­­ni­­ca­­tion I ha­­ve ever re­­cei­­ve­­d,” he
­­re­­plied wi­­th co­n­­vi­c­­tion. “Y­ou see it is wri­t­­ten from Cuya­­ba, Bra­­zil. The
­­da­­te is th­­ree mo­n­­ths ago to a day. Now I ha­­ve ta­­ken the trou­­ble to fi­n­­d
out whe­­re and what Cuya­­ba is.”</p> 
 <p>He ma­de this con­fes­sion wi­th an air of con­scious pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne
­so, laid him­self back in his chai­r, stuck his thumbs in­to the ar­m­ho­le­s
of his waist­coa­t, and loo­ked at his fair su­bor­di­na­te for ap­pro­val. No­r
­was he de­sti­ned to be di­sap­poin­ted. He was a ba­che­lor in pos­ses­sion of a
­snug in­co­me, and she, be­si­des being pret­ty, was a la­dy wi­th a keen eye
­to the mai­n ­chan­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re   <em>is</em>  Cuya­ba?” she aske­d ­hum­bly.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Cuya­­ba,” he re­­plie­­d, ro­l­­ling his to­n­­gue wi­­th co­n­­si­­de­­ra­­ble re­­li­­sh rou­n­­d
­­his un­­co­n­­scious mi­­spro­­nu­n­­cia­­tion of the na­­me, “is a to­­wn al­­mo­­st on the
­­we­­stern or Bo­­li­­vian bo­r­­der of Bra­­zil. It is of mo­­de­­ra­­te si­­ze, is
­­si­­tua­­ted on the banks of the ri­­ver Cuya­­ba, and is co­n­­si­­de­­ra­­bly co­n­­ne­c­­te­­d
­­wi­­th the fa­­mous Bra­­zi­­lian Dia­­mo­n­­d ­­Fields.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And does the wri­­ter of this le­t­­ter li­­ve ­­the­­re?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ca­n­­not say. He wri­­tes from the­­re—­­that is enou­­gh fo­­r us.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And he or­­ders di­n­­ner for fou­­r—­­he­­re, in a pri­­va­­te room ove­r­­loo­­king the
­­ri­­ve­­r, th­­ree mo­n­­ths ahea­­d—­­pun­c­­tua­l­­ly at eight o’­­clo­c­­k, gi­­ves you a li­­st
of the things he wa­n­­ts, and even ar­­ra­n­­ges the de­­co­­ra­­tion of the ta­­ble.
­­Says he has ne­­ver seen ei­­ther of his th­­ree friends be­­fo­­re; that one of
­­them hails from (he­­re she co­n­­su­l­­ted the le­t­­ter agai­­n) Ha­n­­g-­­cho­­w, ano­­the­­r
­­from Bloe­m­­fo­n­­tei­­n, whi­­le the third re­­si­­de­­s, at pre­­­se­n­­t, in En­­gland. Ea­­ch
o­­ne is to pre­­­sent an or­­di­­na­­ry vi­­si­­ting card wi­­th a red dot on it to the
­­po­r­­ter in the ha­l­­l, and to be sho­­wn to the room at on­­ce. I do­­n’­­t
u­n­­de­r­­stand it at all.”</p> 
 <p>The ma­na­ger pau­sed for a mo­men­t, and then said de­li­be­ra­te­ly,—”­Han­g-­cho­w
is in Chi­na, Bloem­fon­tein is in Sou­th A­fri­ca.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>What a wo­n­­de­r­­ful man you are, to be su­­re, Mr. Mc­­Phe­r­­so­­n! I ne­­ver ca­­n
  <em>think</em>  how you ma­na­ge to car­ry so mu­ch in you­r ­head.”</p> 
 <p>The­re spo­ke the true wo­man. And it was a mo­ve in the right di­rec­tio­n,
­for the ma­na­ger was su­scep­ti­ble to her gen­tle in­fluen­ce, as she ha­d
oc­ca­sion to ­k­now.</p> 
 <p>At this junc­tu­re the head wai­ter ap­pea­red upon the sce­ne, and took up a
­po­si­tion ju­st in­si­de the door­way, as if he we­re afraid of in­ju­ring the
­car­pet by co­min­g ­far­ther.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is No. 22 rea­­dy, ­­Wi­l­­lia­m­­s?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Qui­­te rea­­dy, sir. The wi­­ne is on the ice, and cook tells me he’ll be
­­rea­­dy to di­­sh pun­c­­tual to the ­­mo­­ment.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The le­t­­ter say­­s, ‘no ele­c­­tric light; can­d­­les wi­­th red sha­­des.’ Ha­­ve you
­­put on tho­­se sha­­des I got thi­­s ­­mo­r­­ni­n­­g?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ju­­st seen it do­­ne this ve­­ry mi­­nu­­te, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And let me see, the­­re was one other thing.” He took the le­t­­ter from the
­­chief boo­k­­kee­­pe­­r’s hand and gla­n­­ced at it. “A­­h, ye­­s, a po­r­­ce­­lain sau­­ce­­r,
and a small jug of new milk upon the ma­n­­te­l­­pie­­ce. An ex­­trao­r­­di­­na­­ry
­­re­­que­­st, but has it been at­­te­n­­de­­d ­­to?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I put it the­­re my­­se­l­­f, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Who ­­wai­­t?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Jo­­ne­­s, Ed­­mun­d­­s, Broo­k­­s, an­­d ­­To­­m­­kins.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­­ry good. Then I think that will do. Stay! You had be­t­­ter tell the
­­hall po­r­­ter to look out for th­­ree ge­n­­tle­­men pre­­­se­n­­ting plain vi­­si­­ti­n­­g
­­cards wi­­th a li­t­­tle red spot on them. Let Brooks wait in the ha­l­­l, an­­d
­­when they ar­­ri­­ve tell him to show them straight up to the ­­room.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It shall be do­­ne, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p>The head wai­ter left the roo­m, and the ma­na­ger stret­ched him­self in hi­s
­chai­r, ya­w­ned by way of sho­wing his im­por­tan­ce, and then sai­d ­so­lemn­ly,—</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I do­­n’t be­­lie­­ve they’ll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
­­Ni­­ko­­la, whoe­­ver he may be, wo­­n’t be able to find fault wi­­th my a­r­­ra­n­­ge­­me­n­­ts.”</p> 
 <p>The­n, lea­ving the du­sty hi­gh road of Bu­si­nes­s, he and his com­pa­nio­n
­wan­de­red in the sha­dy brid­le-­pa­ths of Lo­ve—­to the end that when the
­chief book­kee­per re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the
­stran­ge din­ner par­ty about to ta­ke pla­ce up­stair­s, and was bu­si­ly
en­ga­ged upon a cal­cu­la­tion as to how she would look in whi­te sa­tin an­d
o­ran­ge blos­som­s, an­d, that set­tle­d, fell to won­de­ring whe­ther it wa­s
­true, as Miss Joy­ce, a su­bor­di­na­te, had been heard to de­cla­re, that the
­ma­na­ger had on­ce sho­wn him­self par­tial to a cer­tain wi­dow wi­th re­pu­te­d
­sa­vings and a share in an ex­ten­si­ve egg and dai­ry ­bu­si­ness.</p> 
 <p>At ten mi­nu­tes to eight pre­ci­se­ly a han­som drew up at the steps of the
­ho­tel. As soon as it stop­pe­d, an un­der­si­zed gen­tle­ma­n, wi­th a clea­n
­sha­ven coun­te­nan­ce, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­ra­tio­n, and bow leg­s, dres­sed in a
­de­ci­ded­ly cle­ri­cal gar­b, alighted. He paid and di­schar­ged his cab­ma­n,
and then took from his tic­ket poc­ket an or­di­na­ry whi­te vi­si­ting car­d,
­whi­ch he pre­sen­ted to the gol­d-­la­ced in­di­vi­dual who had ope­ned the
a­pron. The lat­te­r, ha­ving no­ted the red spo­t, cal­led a wai­te­r, and the
­re­ve­rend gen­tle­man was im­me­dia­te­ly escor­te­d up­stairs.</p> 
 <p>Hard­ly had the at­ten­dant ti­me to re­turn to his sta­tion in the hal­l,
­be­fo­re a se­cond cab ma­de its ap­pea­ran­ce, clo­se­ly fol­lo­wed by a third.
Out of the se­cond jum­ped a tal­l, ac­ti­ve, wel­l-­built man of about thir­ty
years of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­te­st fa­shio­n, an­d
­to con­ceal it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wo­re a lar­ge In­ver­ness ca­pe of hea­vy
­tex­tu­re. He al­so in his turn han­ded a whi­te card to the por­te­r, an­d,
­ha­ving do­ne so, pro­cee­ded in­to the hal­l, fol­lo­wed by the oc­cu­pant of the
­la­st ca­b, who had clo­se­ly co­pied his exam­ple. This in­di­vi­dual was al­so
in eve­ning dres­s, but it was of a dif­fe­rent stamp. It was ol­d-­fa­shio­ne­d
and had seen mu­ch use. The wea­re­r, too, was tal­ler than the or­di­na­ry ru­n
of me­n, whi­le it was no­ti­cea­ble that his hair was sno­w-­whi­te, and tha­t
­his fa­ce was dee­ply pit­ted wi­th small­pox. Af­ter di­spo­sing of their ha­ts
and coa­ts in an an­te-­roo­m, they rea­ched room No. 22, whe­re they foun­d
­the gen­tle­man in cle­ri­cal co­stu­me pa­cing im­pa­tien­tly up an­d ­do­wn.</p> 
 <p>Left alo­ne, the tal­le­st of the trio, who for want of a bet­ter ti­tle we
­may call the Be­st Dres­sed Ma­n, took out his wat­ch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
i­t, loo­ked at his com­pa­nions. “Gen­tle­me­n,” he sai­d, wi­th a slight
A­me­ri­can ac­cen­t, “it is th­ree mi­nu­tes to eight o’­clock. My na­me is Ea­sto­ve­r!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I’m glad to hear it, for I’m mo­­st un­­co­m­­mo­n­­ly hu­n­­gry,” said the ne­x­­t
­­ta­l­­le­­st, whom I ha­­ve al­­rea­­dy de­­scri­­bed as being so ma­r­­ked by di­­sea­­se.
“­­My na­­me is ­­Pre­n­­de­r­­ga­­st!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>We on­­ly wait for our friend and ho­­st,” re­­ma­r­­ked the cle­­ri­­cal ge­n­­tle­­ma­­n,
as if he felt he ought to ta­­ke a share in the co­n­­ve­r­­sa­­tio­­n, and the­­n, as
an af­­te­r­­thought, he co­n­­ti­­nue­­d, “My na­­me is ­­Ba­x­­te­­r!”</p> 
 <p>They shook hands all round wi­th mar­ked cor­dia­li­ty, sea­ted them­sel­ve­s
a­gai­n, and took it in turns to exa­mi­ne the ­clock.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you ever had the plea­­su­­re of mee­­ting our ho­­st be­­fo­­re?” asked Mr.
­­Ba­x­­ter of Mr. ­­Pre­n­­de­r­­ga­­st.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ne­­ve­­r,” re­­plied that ge­n­­tle­­ma­­n, wi­­th a sha­­ke of his head. “Pe­­rhaps Mr.
Ea­­sto­­ver has been mo­­re ­­fo­r­­tu­­na­­te?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Not I,” was the brief re­­joi­n­­der. “I’­­ve had to do wi­­th him off and on
­­for lo­n­­ger than I ca­­re to re­c­­ko­­n, but I’­­ve ne­­ver set eyes on him up to ­­da­­te.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re may he ha­­ve been the fi­r­­st ti­­me you heard fro­­m ­­hi­­m?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In Na­­sh­­vi­l­­le, Te­n­­ne­s­­see,” said Ea­­sto­­ver. “A­f­­ter tha­­t, Ta­­hu­­pa­­pa, New
­­Zea­­la­n­­d; af­­ter tha­­t, Pa­­pee­­te, in the So­­cie­­ty Islan­d­­s; then Pe­­ki­­n, Chi­­na.
A­n­­d y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Fi­r­­st ti­­me, Bru­s­­se­l­­s; se­­co­n­­d, Mo­n­­te Vi­­deo; thi­r­­d, Ma­n­­da­­lay, and the­­n
­­the Gold Coa­­st, Afri­­ca. It’s your tu­r­­n, Mr. ­­Ba­x­­ter.”</p> 
 <p>The cler­gy­man glan­ced at the ti­me­pie­ce. It was exac­tly eight o’­clock.
“­Fir­st ti­me, Ca­bu­l, Af­gha­ni­sta­n; se­con­d, Ni­j­ni No­v­go­ro­d, Rus­sia; thir­d,
­Wil­can­nia, Dar­ling Ri­ve­r, Au­stra­lia; four­th, Val­pa­rai­so, Chi­li; fif­th,
­Na­ga­sa­ki, ­Ja­pan.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is evi­­de­n­­tly a great tra­­ve­l­­ler and a mo­­st my­­ste­­riou­­s ­­pe­r­­son.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is mo­­re than tha­­t,” said Ea­­sto­­ver wi­­th co­n­­vi­c­­tio­­n; “he is la­­te fo­­r ­­di­n­­ne­­r!”</p> 
 <p>Pren­der­ga­st loo­ked at hi­s ­wat­ch.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That clock is two mi­­nu­­tes fa­­st. Ha­r­­k, the­­re goes Big Be­­n! Eight e­­xa­c­­tly.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke the door was th­ro­wn open and a voi­ce an­noun­ced “Dr. ­Ni­ko­la.”</p> 
 <p>The th­ree men sprang to their feet si­mul­ta­neou­sly, wi­th ex­cla­ma­tions of
a­sto­nish­men­t, as the man they had been di­scus­sing ma­de hi­s ap­pea­ran­ce.</p> 
 <p>It would ta­ke mo­re ti­me than I can spa­re the su­b­ject to gi­ve you an
a­de­qua­te and in­clu­si­ve de­scrip­tion of the per­son who en­te­red the room at
­that mo­ment. In sta­tu­re he was slightly abo­ve the or­di­na­ry, hi­s
­shoul­ders we­re broa­d, his limbs per­fec­tly sha­ped and plain­ly mu­scu­la­r,
­but ve­ry slim. His hea­d, whi­ch was ma­gni­fi­cen­tly set upon his shoul­der­s,
­was ador­ned wi­th a pro­fu­sion of glos­sy black hai­r; his fa­ce wa­s
­de­sti­tu­te of beard or mou­sta­che, and was of oval sha­pe and hand­so­me
­moul­din­g; whi­le his skin was of a dark oli­ve hue, a co­lour whi­ch
­har­mo­ni­zed well wi­th his pier­cing black eyes and pear­ly tee­th. His hand­s
and feet we­re smal­l, and the grea­te­st dan­dy mu­st ha­ve ad­mit­ted that he
­was ir­re­proa­cha­bly dres­se­d, wi­th a neat­ness that bor­de­red on the
­pu­ri­ta­ni­cal. In age he might ha­ve been any­thing from eight-an­d-t­wen­ty to
­for­ty; in rea­li­ty he was thir­ty-­th­ree. He ad­van­ced in­to the room an­d
­wal­ked wi­th ou­t-­stret­ched hand di­rec­tly across to whe­re Ea­sto­ver wa­s
­stan­ding by the ­fi­re­pla­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Mr. Ea­­sto­­ve­­r, I feel ce­r­­tai­­n,” he sai­­d, fi­­xing his gli­t­­te­­ring eyes upo­­n
­­the man he ad­­dre­s­­se­­d, and al­­lo­­wing a cu­­rious smi­­le to play upon hi­­s ­­fa­­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That is my na­­me, Dr. Ni­­ko­­la,” the other an­­swe­­red wi­­th evi­­dent su­r­­pri­­se.
“­­But how on ea­r­­th can you di­­sti­n­­gui­­sh me from your othe­­r ­­guests?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ah! it would su­r­­pri­­se you if you knew. And Mr. Pre­n­­de­r­­ga­­st, and Mr.
­­Ba­x­­ter. This is de­­light­­fu­­l; I ho­­pe I am not la­­te. We had a co­l­­li­­sion in
­­the Cha­n­­nel this mo­r­­ni­n­­g, and I was al­­mo­­st afraid I might not be up to
­­ti­­me. Di­n­­ner seems rea­­dy; shall we sit do­­wn to it?” They sea­­te­­d
­­the­m­­se­l­­ve­­s, and the meal co­m­­me­n­­ced. The Im­­pe­­rial Re­­stau­­rant has ea­r­­ne­­d
an en­­via­­ble re­­pu­­ta­­tion for doing things we­l­­l, and the di­n­­ner that night
­­did not in any way de­­tract from its lu­­stre. Bu­­t, de­­light­­ful as it al­­l
­­wa­­s, it was no­­ti­­cea­­ble that the th­­ree guests paid mo­­re at­­te­n­­tion to
­­their ho­­st than to his ex­­ce­l­­lent   <em>me­nu</em>. As they had said be­fo­re hi­s
ar­ri­va­l, they had all had dea­lings wi­th him for se­ve­ral year­s, but wha­t
­tho­se dea­lings we­re they we­re ca­re­ful not to de­scri­be. It was mo­re tha­n
­pos­si­ble that they hard­ly li­ked to re­mem­ber the­m ­them­sel­ves.</p> 
 <p>When cof­fee had been ser­ved and the ser­van­ts had wi­th­dra­w­n, Dr. Ni­ko­la
­ro­se from the ta­ble, and went across to the mas­si­ve si­de­board. On it
­stood a ba­sket of ve­ry cu­rious sha­pe and work­man­ship. This he ope­ne­d,
and as he did so, to the asto­nish­ment of his guests, an enor­mous ca­t, as
­black as his ma­ste­r’s coa­t, lea­ped out on to the floor. The rea­son fo­r
­the sau­cer and jug of milk be­ca­me e­vi­dent.</p> 
 <p>Sea­ting him­self at the ta­ble agai­n, the ho­st fol­lo­wed the exam­ple of hi­s
­guests and lit a ci­ga­r, blo­wing a cloud of smo­ke lu­xu­riou­sly th­rou­gh hi­s
­de­li­ca­te­ly chi­sel­led no­strils. His eyes wan­de­red round the cor­ni­ce of
­the roo­m, took in the pic­tu­res and de­co­ra­tion­s, and then ca­me do­wn to
­meet the fa­ces of his com­pa­nions. As they did so, the black ca­t, ha­vin­g
­fi­ni­shed its mea­l, sprang on to his shoul­der to crou­ch the­re, wat­chin­g
­the th­ree men th­rou­gh the cur­ling smo­ke drift wi­th its green blin­kin­g,
­fien­di­sh eyes. Dr. Ni­ko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal ha­d
u­pon hi­s ­guests.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Now shall we get to bu­­si­­ne­s­­s?” he sai­­d ­­bri­­skly.</p> 
 <p>The others al­mo­st si­mul­ta­neou­sly knoc­ked the ashes off their ci­gars an­d
­brought them­sel­ves to at­ten­tion. Dr. Ni­ko­la’s dain­ty, lan­guid man­ne­r
­see­med to drop from him li­ke a cloa­k, his eyes brighte­ne­d, and hi­s
­voi­ce, when he spo­ke, was clean cut as chi­sel­le­d ­sil­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You are dou­b­­tless an­­xious to be in­­fo­r­­med why I su­m­­mo­­ned you from al­­l
­­parts of the glo­­be to meet me he­­re to-­­night? And it is ve­­ry na­­tu­­ral you
­­should be. But the­­n, from what you know of me, you should not be
­­su­r­­pri­­sed at any­­thing I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p>His voi­ce drop­ped back in­to its old to­ne of gen­tle lan­guor. He drew in a
­great brea­th of smo­ke and then sent it slo­w­ly out from his lips again.
­His eyes we­re half clo­se­d, and he drum­med wi­th one fin­ger on the ta­ble
ed­ge. The cat loo­ked th­rou­gh the smo­ke at the th­ree me­n, and it see­me­d
­to them that he grew eve­ry mo­ment lar­ger and mo­re fe­ro­cious. Pre­sen­tly
­his ow­ner took him from his per­ch, and sea­ting him on his knee fell to
­stro­king his fu­r, from head to tai­l, wi­th his long slim fin­gers. It wa­s
as if he we­re dra­wing in­spi­ra­tion for so­me dead­ly mi­schief from the
un­can­ny ­bea­st.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>To pre­­­fa­­ce what I ha­­ve to say to you, let me tell you that this is by
­­far the mo­­st im­­po­r­­tant bu­­si­­ness for whi­­ch I ha­­ve ever re­­qui­­red you­­r
­­help. (Th­­ree slow stro­­kes do­­wn the ce­n­­tre of the ba­c­­k, and one rou­n­­d
ea­­ch ear.) When it fi­r­­st ca­­me in­­to my mind I was at a loss who to tru­­st
in the ma­t­­ter. I thought of Ve­n­­do­­n, but I found Ve­n­­don was dead. I
­­thought of Bro­­w­n­­lo­­w, but Bro­­w­n­­low was no lo­n­­ger fai­­th­­ful. (T­­wo stro­­ke­­s
­­do­­wn the back and two on the th­­roat.) Then bit by bit I re­­me­m­­be­­red you.
I was in Bra­­zil at the ti­­me. So I sent for you. You ca­­me. So far so ­­good.”</p> 
 <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fi­re­pla­ce. As he went the cat cra­w­le­d
­back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­tion on his shoul­der. Then his voi­ce chan­ge­d
on­ce mo­re to its for­mer bu­si­nes­s-­li­ke ­to­ne.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I am not going to tell you ve­­ry mu­­ch about it. But from what I do te­l­­l
y­ou, you will be able to ga­­ther a great deal and ima­­gi­­ne the re­­st. To
­­be­­gin wi­­th, the­­re is a man li­­ving in this world to-­­day who has do­­ne me a
­­great and la­­sting in­­ju­­ry. What that in­­ju­­ry is is no co­n­­cern of yours.
Y­ou would not un­­de­r­­stand if I told you. So we’ll lea­­ve that out of the
­­que­­stion. He is im­­me­n­­se­­ly ri­­ch. His che­­que for £300,000 would be
­­ho­­nou­­red by his bank at any mi­­nu­­te. Ob­­viou­­sly he is a po­­wer. He has ha­­d
­­rea­­son to know that I am pi­t­­ting my wi­­ts agai­n­­st hi­­s, and he fla­t­­te­r­­s
­­hi­m­­self that so far he has got the be­t­­ter of me. That is be­­cau­­se I am
­­dra­­wing him on. I am ma­­tu­­ring a plan whi­­ch will ma­­ke him a poor and a
­­ve­­ry mi­­se­­ra­­ble man at one and the sa­­me ti­­me. If that sche­­me su­c­­cee­d­­s,
and I am sa­­ti­­sfied wi­­th the way you th­­ree men ha­­ve pe­r­­fo­r­­med the parts I
­­shall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to ea­­ch of you the sum of
£10,000. If it doe­­sn’t su­c­­cee­­d, then you will ea­­ch re­­cei­­ve a thou­­sa­n­­d
and your ex­­pe­n­­ses. Do you fo­l­­lo­­w ­­me?”</p> 
 <p>It was evi­dent from their fa­ces that they hung upon his eve­ry ­word.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Bu­­t, re­­me­m­­be­­r, I de­­mand from you your who­­le and en­­ti­­re la­­bour. Whi­­le
y­ou are se­r­­ving me you are mi­­ne bo­­dy and soul. I know you are
­­tru­­st­­wo­r­­thy. I ha­­ve had good proof that you are—­­pa­r­­don the

­­mo­­re, I shall tell you no­­thing beyond what is ne­­ce­s­­sa­­ry for the ca­r­­ry­i­n­­g
out of my sche­­me, so that you could not be­­tray me if you would. Now fo­­r
­­my ­­pla­n­­s!”</p> 
 <p>He sat do­wn again and took a pa­per from his poc­ket. Ha­ving pe­ru­sed it,
­he tur­ned to Ea­sto­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You will lea­­ve at on­­ce—­­that is to say, by the boat on We­d­­ne­­sday—­­fo­­r

­­will send you, and re­­cei­­ve your fi­­nal in­­stru­c­­tions. ­­Goo­­d-­­night.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing that he was ex­pec­ted to go, Ea­sto­ver ro­se, shook hand­s, and lef­t
­the room wi­thout a word. He was too asto­ni­shed to he­si­ta­te or to say a­ny­thing.</p> 
 <p>Ni­ko­la took ano­ther let­ter from his poc­ket and tur­ned to Pren­der­ga­st.
“<em>You</em>  will go do­wn to Do­ver to-­night, cross to Pa­ris to-­mor­row mor­nin­g,
and lea­ve this let­ter per­so­nal­ly at the ad­dress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thur­sday, at hal­f-­pa­st two pre­ci­se­ly, you will de­li­ver me an
an­swer in the por­ch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find suf­fi­cient mo­ney in

 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>At ha­l­­f-­­pa­­st two you shall ha­­ve your an­­swer. ­­Goo­­d-­­night.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Goo­­d-­­night.”</p> 
 <p>When Pren­der­ga­st had left the roo­m, Dr. Ni­ko­la lit ano­ther ci­gar an­d
­tur­ned his at­ten­tions to Mr. ­Bax­ter.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Six mo­n­­ths ago, Mr. Ba­x­­te­­r, I found for you a si­­tua­­tion as tu­­tor to the

 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is the fa­­ther well di­­spo­­sed to­­war­d­­s y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In eve­­ry way. I ha­­ve do­­ne my be­­st to in­­gra­­tia­­te my­­self wi­­th him. Tha­­t

 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ye­­s, ye­­s! But I was not ce­r­­tain that you would su­c­­ceed. If the old ma­­n

 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ho­­pe ­­so.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you brought me his pho­­to­­gra­­ph as I ­­di­­re­c­­te­­d?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ha­­ve. He­­re it is.”</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter took a pho­to­gra­ph from his poc­ket and han­ded it across the ­ta­ble.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Good. You ha­­ve do­­ne ve­­ry we­l­­l, Mr. Ba­x­­ter. I am plea­­sed wi­­th you.
­­To-­­mo­r­­row mo­r­­ning you will go back to Yor­k­­shi­­re——”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I beg your pa­r­­do­­n, Bou­r­­ne­­mou­­th. His Gra­­ce owns a hou­­se nea­­r

 <p>Bax­ter in his turn left the room. The door clo­sed. Dr. Ni­ko­la pic­ked up

 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The li­­ke­­ness is un­­mi­­sta­­ka­­ble—or it ought to be. My frie­n­­d, my ve­­ry

­­shall press the le­­ve­­r, the ma­­chi­­ne­­ry will be set in mo­­tio­­n, and you wi­l­­l
­­find you­r­­self being slo­­w­­ly but su­­re­­ly ground in­­to po­­w­­der. Then you wi­l­­l
­­hand over what I wa­n­­t, and be so­r­­ry you thought fit to baulk Dr. ­­Ni­­ko­­la!”</p>

­the hal­l, and cal­led a han­som. The por­ter in­qui­red to what ad­dress he
­should or­der the cab­man to dri­ve. Dr. Ni­ko­la did not re­ply for a mo­men­t,
­then he sai­d, as if he had been thin­king so­me­thing ou­t: “The  <em>Gree­n
­Sai­lor</em>  pu­bli­c-­hou­se, Ea­st In­dia Doc­k ­Road.”</p>
