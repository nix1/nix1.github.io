The recipe is highly inspired by `Cooking for Geeks <http://www.cookingforgeeks.com/>`_
– most importantly, the proportions are taken from there.

You’ll need:

* 170 g (6 oz / 1⅓ cup) flour
* 5 g (0.2 oz / 1 teaspoon) table salt
* 20 g (0.7 oz) compressed yeast or 10 g (0.35 oz / 1 tablespoon) instant yeast
* 120 g (4.23 oz / ½ cup) warm water

When you have all the ingredients…

#. In a bowl, mix salt with flour
#. Add instant yeast to flour or dissolve compressed yeast in water
#. Pour the liquid/water into the bowl and quickly mix using a spoon
#. You’re done, just cover it and leave it alone for 4 hours

The dough will be a bit sticky, so sprinkle it with flour. Shaping is probably the easiest using
a rolling pin on non-stick paper. It takes some practice to get a nice shape, so don’t put too
much attention to the shape, just try to make it as flat as possible.

Preheat your oven to the highest temperature available.

    Hint: You can put some water in a metal cup or bowl into the oven – water vapor will enhance heat
    transfer and prevent drying out.

Parbake for a few minutes. If the crust becomes brown, it’s been inside for too long – take it out immediately when it starts changing the colour!

    Hint: Parbaking may be considered cheating… but it allows you to make a perfect pizza without
    a professional-grade oven. Also, if you made more dough, you can now freeze the pizza
    and finish it off later, whenever you wish!

Top with your favourite ingredients (most likely some tomato sauce and grated cheese).
Bake again for a few minutes until the crust is brown enough (but not burnt) and the cheese is melted.

Enjoy!
