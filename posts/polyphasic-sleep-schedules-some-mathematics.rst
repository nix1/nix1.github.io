In the first post not related to web development, I’d like to present some calculations
on `polyphasic sleep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep>`__ which I’ve made for myself.

If you have no idea what I’m talking about, you’d better read some introduction first.

The basic formula behind most of the polyphasic sleep patterns is that a 20-min nap is roughly
equivalent to 1.5 hour of “normal” sleep. Based on the data
`presented by Dustin Curtis <http://www.dustincurtis.com/sleep.html>`__, we have:

====================== ===================== ================== ================
                       Number of 20-min naps Core sleep (hours) Total sleep time
The Waste (monophasic) 0                     8 h                8 h
The Siesta (biphasic)  1                     6 h                6.3 h
The Everyman 2-nap     2                     4.5 h              5.2 h
The Everyman 3-nap     3                     3 h                4 h
The Everyman 4-nap     4                     1.5 h              2.8 h
Uberman                5                     0.33 h (20 mins)   2 h
====================== ===================== ================== ================

I don’t understand why in the article written by Dustin Curtis the 4-nap Everyman is
defined as four or five naps plus 1.5 h core sleep. The 5-nap Everyman is the same as
Uberman, and the 1.5 h core sleep seems to be a waste of time.
You may be surprised that I’ve included Uberman as 20-min core sleep plus five 20-min naps,
not as six naps. The reason for that is that I wanted to have some continuity when counting naps :)
.. Let’s make a graph:

As you can see, the relation between the number of naps and the total amount of sleep is **not linear**.
So **the benefit of going from Monophasic to Biphasic is bigger than going from the 4-nap
Everyman to Uberman**.

====================== ================ ================= =========================
                       Total awake time More than in Mono More than in the previous
The Waste (monophasic) 16 h             0%                –
The Siesta (biphasic)  17.7 h           10.4%             10.4%
The Everyman 2-nap     18.8 h           17.7%             6.6%
The Everyman 3-nap     20               25%               6.2%
The Everyman 4-nap     21.2             32.3%             5.8%
Uberman                22               37.5%             3.9%
====================== ================ ================= =========================

Note that **it doesn’t really matter how much less you sleep, it matters how much more time
you have and how much more you can get done**. Keeping in mind that each additional nap
introduces significant disturbance into one’s lifestyle and scheduling, I believe that **there
must be some optimum in beetween**. My theory seem to be supported by the fact that the longest
running Uberman sleepers I know about, that is `PureDoxyk <http://www.puredoxyk.com/index.php/polyphasic-sleep-portal/>`__
and `Steve Pavlina <http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/>`__ have both switched
to Everyman-3. On the other end of the spectrum, we have whole societies that use the `1-nap biphasic
Siesta sleeping pattern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta>`__ (I lived in Italy for some time and
I think that the siesta is great!), so it must have been really worth the trouble, don’t you think?
